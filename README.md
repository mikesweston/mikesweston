I worked in software from 1977 (when I was in high school and worked part-time at Digital Equipment Corporation) until I retired in 2018 or 2019, depending on whether or not very low-volume consulting counts. Shortly after that I moved from Silicon Valley (where I grew up) to Honolulu (where my wife grew up). These days the only software I do is trying to keep up with my mentee that I was matched with by [Eldera](https://www.eldera.ai/).

My main hobby *was* running, including 9 completed 100-mile races, but at least for now I'm stuck walking due some nerve pain. Other hobbies include beer tasting, movies, and podcasts. I'm sometimes on the Fediverse and trying to minimize time on corporate social media.
